# data-science-training

This repo consists of a couple sets of exercises I performed in 2016 to learn python while introducing myself to data science:

* [Twitter Sentiment](twitter-sentiment/README.md)
* [MapReduce](mapreduce/README.md)


* Note - I haven't executed the code for years, so the sets may not be fully functional without a bit of work
